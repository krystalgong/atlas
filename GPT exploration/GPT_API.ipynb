      "For many programs, individuals are offered both the opportunity to \n",

      "Previous research has explored how individuals’ motivation to pur-\n",
      "sue their goals is shaped by temporal landmarks. Temporal landmarks \n",
      "have been defined as distinct events that “stand in marked contrast to \n",
      "the seemingly unending stream of trivial and ordinary occurrences that \n",
      "happen to us everyday” (Shum, 1998, p. 423). They include transition \n",
      "points on socially shared calendars (e.g., the start of a new season) and \n",
      "special events on personal life timelines (e.g., birthdays; Robinson, \n",
      "1986; Shum, 1998). Importantly, different temporal landmarks have \n",
      "different properties. In particular, temporal landmarks have been shown \n",
      "to differ in the degree to which people feel they inaugurate new be-\n",
      "ginnings (Dai et al., 2015). For example, people tend to perceive tem-\n",
      "poral landmarks that mark the first day of a new calendar period (e.g., \n",
      "the first day of a new season, week, month, or year) as new beginnings. \n",
      "However, temporal landmarks that do not coincide with the start of a \n",
      "new calendar cycle, like Thanksgiving and Valentine’s Day, are viewed \n",
      "differently. In addition, first experiences (e.g., a first date or first job \n",
      "after college) tend to be viewed as new beginnings while similar, later \n",
      "experiences (e.g., a ninth date or sixth job after college) are not (Dai \n",
      "et al., 2015; Shum, 1998). \n",
      "Recent research has shown that the new beginnings or fresh starts \n",
      "inaugurated by temporal landmarks can boost individuals’ motivation to \n",
      "pursue their long-term goals and make future-oriented choices (Dai \n",
      "et al., 2014, 2015; Davydenko & Peetz, 2019; Hennecke & Converse, \n",
